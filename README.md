# House-price-prediction-using-ann
This project focuses on harnessing the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict house prices accurately. By analyzing a vast dataset comprising property features like location, size, amenities, and historical price trends, our ANN model will learn intricate patterns and correlations. This predictive tool will empower homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make well-informed decisions by providing precise estimates of property values. With the potential to revolutionize the real estate market, our project seeks to enhance transparency and efficiency in property transactions through cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
